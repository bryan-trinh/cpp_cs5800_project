# cpp_cs5800_project

## Overview
The Bronco Centerpointe Dining Management System (BCDMS or BCDM System) has requested for our help to address certain ongoing issues that they are unable to address:
*  Multiple unconnected restaurant subsystems (food items, orders, customers)
*  Redundancies in data (customer, receipts, orders)
*  No automation - manual efforts (receipts, order maintenance, transaction information)
*  Inaccuracy in recording past food item prices and orders
*  Nonexistent food item search
*  Nonexistent discount schema
*  No intelligent report

Our deliverables will address the issues and provide a web component for ordering.
